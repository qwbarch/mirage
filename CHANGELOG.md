## Changelog

### 1.28.0

- Networking now works properly for ``v73``.

Note: There is currently a bug reported on this version that masked enemies holding items can bug out and
not attack anyone.
**I highly recommend disabling this feature until I figure out a fix.**

### 1.27.0

- Updated to Lethal Company ``v73``.
- Updated UnityNetcodePatcher to ``v4.4.2``.

### 1.26.0

- Fixed a conflict with LethalIntelligence. LethalIntelligence should now fully take control of fake item logic. Huge thanks to VirusTLNR for this fix.
- Add the LethalSettings [fix](<https://github.com/willis81808/LethalSettings/pull/8>) directly into Mirage since the pull request still hasn't been merged yet.

### 1.25.1

- Optimized startup time.

### 1.24.1

- Fixed a potential conflict with [LethalIntelligenceExperimental](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/LethalIntelligenceExperimental/>) where Mirage replaced the masked's ``runtimeAnimatorController`` when it wasn't needed.

### 1.24.0

- Fixed held items not showing for non-host clients
- Fixed a ``NullReferenceException`` being thrown with ``PlayerAnimationEvent`` thanks to [XuXiaolan](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/XuXiaolan/>)

Thanks to [a glitched npc](<https://www.twitch.tv/a_glitched_npc>) and [WinterMantis](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/WinterMantis/>) for helping me test!

### 1.23.1

- Fixed the broken held item positions (e.g. the engine item was too low).

Huge thanks to [XuXiaolan](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/XuXiaolan/>) and [VirusTLNR](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/>) for teaching me how to use the Unity editor to grab and extract the held item animations myself (I'm a complete noob at Unity). This update would not have been possible without their help.

Check out [XuXiaolan](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/XuXiaolan/>)'s [CodeRebirth 2](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/XuXiaolan/CodeRebirth_2/>) and [VirusTLNR](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/>)'s [LethalIntelligence](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/LethalIntelligenceExperimental/>)!

### 1.23.0

- Added a new config option ``Chance for flashlights to emit light``. Default value: ``50``.
- Changed ``Drop store item on death`` to a new config option that takes a percentage instead.
- Changed ``Drop scrap item on death`` to a new config option that takes a percentage instead.
- Fixed certain enemies and items failing to register to the config.

### 1.22.0

- Masked enemies holding items can now drop their items.
- Added a config option called ``Drop store item on death``. Default value: ``false``.
- Added a config option called ``Drop scrap item on death``. Default value: ``true``.
- Added a config option called ``Scrap value multiplier``.
    - This only affects the scrap value multiplier for scrap items dropped by masked enemies.
    - Defualt value: ``1.0``.

### 1.21.0

- Renamed ``Masked item spawn chance`` to ``Chance to spawn with item`` and moved to a new file: ``Mirage.Items.cfg`` (you'll need to re-do this config option, sorry).
    - Default value: 80
    - This means that by default, there is a 80% chance for a masked enemy to spawn with a held item, and a 20% chance to hold nothing.
- Added a new config option ``Chance to roll as store item``.
    - Default vlaue: 50.
    - This means that by default, there is a 50% chance for the held item to be a store item. Otherwise, it'll be a scrap item using the current round's scrap weights.
- Added a section in ``Mirage.Items.cfg`` called ``Store Item Weights``.
    - This section contains a weight option for every store item.
    - By default, only walkie-talkie, shovel, pro-flashlight, stun grenade, extension ladder, and spray paint, are enabled.
    - The higher the number relative to others, the higher the chance for that item to be used by a masked.
- Added a section in ``Mirage.Items.cfg`` called ``Scrap Item Blacklist``.
    - This section contains a true/false option for every scrap in the game.
    - When a value is set to ``true``, masked enemies will never hold that item.

### 1.20.2

- Fixed a compatibility issue with [LethalIntelligence](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/LethalIntelligenceExperimental/>) causing Mirage to fail to load.
- Held item feature is now automatically disabled when LethalIntelligence is installed, to allow LethalIntelligence to handle masked holding items instead.

### 1.20.1

- Masked holding items no longer show a hover tooltip, thanks to [mattymatty](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/mattymatty/>).
- Fixed a bug that caused an error on startup when [BepInEx Faster Load AssetBundles Patcher](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DiFFoZ/BepInEx_Faster_Load_AssetBundles_Patcher/>) is installed, thanks to [DiFFoZ](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DiFFoZ/>).
- Fixed a bug that caused items being held by masked enemies to persist between rounds.

### 1.20.0

- Masked enemies are now able to spawn holding an item at a random chance (in percentage).
    - Config name: ``Masked item spawn chance``
    - Default value: 50
    - Note: This config option likely conflicts with [LethalIntelligence](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/LethalIntelligenceExperimental/>). You should disable this option (set it to 0) if you use LethalIntelligence.
- ``Masked enemy spawn chance`` default value has been lowered to ``0.5f``.

Full credits:
- [Piggy](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Piggy/) for his MIT licensed asset bundle.
- [VirusTLNR](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/) for the held item animation implementation and for helping me out when I had questions.

Held item animation is taken from [LethalIntelligence](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/LethalIntelligenceExperimental/) (with permission). Go check this mod out!

### 1.19.1

- Attempt to fix a bug that was causing some modpacks to only record voices for hosts.
- Now uses a unity compatible null-check, hopefully eliminating some null reference exceptions. Thanks to [DiFFoZ](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DiFFoZ/) for pointing it out and providing a solution!

### 1.19.0

- Fixed a ``NullReferenceException`` when leaving back to the main menu.
- Added a setting to the ``LethalSettings`` menu: ``muteVoiceMimic``
    - When enabled, all voice mimicking will be disabled.
    - Default value: false.
    - This setting is there for players who don't want to hear any voice mimicking while everyone else in the group wants to hear them.
- Added a config option: ``Copy masked visuals``.
    - When enabled, masked enemies will copy the player visuals it mimics.
    - Default value: true.
    - By default, this is the same behaviour as it always has been. The config simply gives the user the option to disable it if they prefer to.
- Bumped dependency for ``ButteryStancakes-MaskFixes`` from ``1.2.1`` -> ``1.2.2``.

### 1.18.2

- Added [MaskFixes](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ButteryStancakes/MaskFixes/) by [ButteryStancakes](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ButteryStancakes/) as a ThunderStore dependency, since it fixes many of the issues that vanilla Masked have.

### 1.18.1

- Replaced the deprecated dependency [MaskedFixes](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/MaskedFixes/) with [MaskedInvisFix](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/MaskedInvisFix/).

Note: I will likely leave this as a dependency as Mirage instead of porting it directly into the mod for two reasons:
- I don't want the maintenance burden that comes with porting someone else's code
- If [VirusTLNR](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/) updates the mod, Mirage users can simply update the mod as well instead of having to wait for me to update it on my end.

Thanks again to [VirusTLNR](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/) for providing this fix!

### 1.18.0

- Fixed an issue with config syncing for some players. This was meant to be the previous update, but it unfortunately didn't work properly.
- Added [MaskedFixes](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/MaskedFixes/>) as a dependency to fix the vanilla invisible masked bug.
    - With permission from [VirusTLNR](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/>), I will integrate the fix into Mirage later on when I have time to look.
- Startup no longer complains about a missing ``Mirage.Enemies.cfg`` folder.

Special thanks:
- ThisGuyHere - For debugging the invisible masked bug, providing enough context for VirusTLNR to work with.
- [VirusTLNR](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/>) - For debugging the invisible masked bug, and creating a solution for it.

### 1.17.0

~~- Fixed an issue with config syncing for some players.~~

Thanks to [Lunxara](<https://www.twitch.tv/lunxara>) for testing the update!

### 1.16.0

- Enemies now have a configurable chance to start mimicking a player's voice - [#134](<https://github.com/qwbarch/mirage/pull/134>) - Thanks to [Kuodos](<https://github.com/Kuodos>) for the contribution.
- Orphaned config entries no longer gets deleted.

Thanks to [Lunxara](<https://www.twitch.tv/lunxara>) for testing yet another update, and confirming it works as expected.  
If anyone would like to contribute to Mirage, take a look at issue [#131](<https://github.com/qwbarch/mirage/issues/131>).
I left a comment at the bottom of the issue on which files to look at.

### 1.15.5

- Fixed a bug that caused some enemies that were disabled in ``Mirage.Enemies.cfg`` to still mimic voices.

### 1.15.4

- ``Mirage.Enemies.cfg`` is now supported on LethalConfig.

**Note**: This file will be re-generated when you run this update. You will need to re-select which enemies you want to mimic voices.

### 1.15.2

- Fixed a log spam issue that occured when Mirage is incompatible with another (unknown) mod.
- This does not fix the incompatibility itself. It only catches the exception and logs a warning about an incompatible enemy.

### 1.15.1

- Slight optimizations.

I now have a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/qwbarch) donation link. If you enjoy using the mod
and have the disposable income, any donations are appreciated!

### 1.15.0

- Incompatible mods such as ``CorporateRestructure`` no longer causes config syncing to fail.
- Added a config option ``Enable player name tags``.
    - When set to false, will prevent player name tags from appearing.
    - This is useful for making it harder to distinguish between masked enemies and players.
    - Default value: ``true`` (same as vanilla).
- Fixed a null exception that was sometimes thrown when returning to the menu.

#### For developers:

As requested by ``Zehs``, I have added methods that allow you to save audio into the ``Mirage/Recording`` folder.  
Expected input is 16-bit audio in normalized form. Audio is internally compressed into ``.opus`` and saved as so.  
Note: These methods are untested, but there shouldn't be any issues out of the box.

```cs
// A random file name is created for you. The full file path is returned when the file is finished writing.
public static ValueTask<string> saveAudioClip(AudioClip audioClip);

// You provide the file name. Note that you only provide the file name without the file extension, as it will be appended with .opus.
public static ValueTask<string> saveAudioClipWithName(string fileName, AudioClip audioClip);

// Use this if you want to skip the step of creating an audio clip.  
// Note: The WaveFormat argument comes from Mirage.Core.dll rather than NAudio.
public static ValueTask<string> saveRecording(string fileName, ArraySegment<float> samples, PCM.WaveFormat format);
```

### 1.14.0

- Added a config option ``Enable radar spin``.
    - When set to false, will prevent masked enemies from spinning on the radar.
    - Default value: ``false``.
- Fixed a bug that caused LethalConfig ``Mirage.General.cfg`` to not load for some players.

### 1.13.0

- Fixed the bugs introduced since v1.9.0:
    - Fixed a bug where voices are sometimes repeated with no delay.
    - Fixed a bug where a voice clip is sometimes played right after another with no delay.
    - Fixed a bug where voice clips can glitch out and sound really weird.
    - Fixed a bug where recordings were sometimes being deleted on startup despite having "never delete recordings" enabled.
    - Exceptions should no longer be thrown when the round is over, or when exiting back to the main menu.
- Heavily optimized the mod. Personally when comparing to vanilla, my fps is identical now. For any developers interested:
    - Due to needing to process audio, the biggest bottleneck with garbage collection since v1.9.0 was the amount of large arrays being allocated.
    - Every instance where an array used to be allocated has been replaced with array pooling.
    - Replaced F# ``Async`` type with ``ValueTask`` for any async code, since ``Async`` causes heap allocations everywhere.
    - Objects that were being created extremely often (e.g. objects containing audio data) are now structs, to avoid unnecessary heap allocations.
    - Audio packet sizes are extremely tiny now, making the networked audio much more efficient.
    - Audio decompression no longer runs on the main thread.
- Audio clips no longer save as ``.mp3``, and are instead saved as ``.opus``.
    - The weird glitchy audio turns out to be an issue with the mp3 encoder I was using.
    - Opus (at the current settings I've set) sounds the same as its ``.wav`` equivalent, while having a file size even smaller than the previous ``.mp3`` files.
- Voice activity detection threshold has been lowered.
    - This makes it more lenient on when it creates recordings, on the downside that you'll have a lot more "garbage" recordings like MirageLegacy (v1.8.X and older) had.
    - This was needed, due to SileroVAD not being perfect which caused recordings to be created either too late, or was stopped too early, causing the audio clip to sound cut off.
- LethalSettings is now a soft dependency and will not crash if LethalSettings is not installed.
    - This is still set as a dependency on Thunderstore due to being the intended user experience.
    - If you are absolutely against using LethalSettings, you and your users can edit your respective settings by editing the ``Mirage/settings.json`` file,
      located in your Lethal Company directory.
    - I highly recommend to keep LethalSettings installed to avoid the need to edit the file manually.
- Added an option to the LethalSettings menu called ``Allow record voice``. When disabled, audio clips will never be created. Useful when paired with ``Never delete recordings``, for those who want to provide their own audio clips.
- LethalConfig is now supported, but only for ``Mirage.General.cfg``. If you want to edit which enemies mimic voices, you still need to edit it via your mod manager.
- ``NAudio.Lame`` is no longer a dependency and can be removed from your modpacks.
- ``Minimum audio duration ms`` and ``Minimum silence duration ms`` has been removed to keep the config simpler.

#### Special thanks:
- [Alecksword](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Alecksword/?section=modpacks>) - For generously dedicating countless hours in voice chat to help debug issues I couldn’t replicate on my own.
- [Winter Mantis](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/WinterMantis/>) and ``Myrin`` - For their help in testing experimental builds and providing consistent feedback on the Lethal Company modding Discord.
- [Lunxara](<https://www.twitch.tv/lunxara>) and [a glitched npc](<https://www.twitch.tv/a_glitched_npc>) - For testing many updates on stream, even when those updates affected their streaming experience.
- [slayer6409](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/slayer6409>) - For helping with profiling Mirage, providing feedback on performance issues.

### 1.12.2

- Fixed a bug introduced in ``12.12.1``, where recordings are created even if the push-to-talk button isn't pressed.
- Fixed a bug that caused some recordings to be choppy.

### 1.12.1

- Recordings no longer cut off while holding your push to talk key (now matches the recording behaviour from older versions of Mirage).
    - The ``Minimum silence duration (in milliseconds)`` config option no longer affects push to talk users, and is only used for voice activity.
    - The ``Minimum audio duration (in milliseconds)`` config option no longer affects push to talk users, and is only used for voice activity.

### 1.12.0

- Fixed the ``AcmNotPossible calling acmFormatSuggest`` exception that caused some players to not be able to use Mirage.
- Audio files are now saved as a ``.mp3`` instead of a ``.wav``. If you have ``NeverDeleteRecordings`` enabled, you will need to delete your previously saved recordings (or convert them to ``.mp3``).

### 1.11.2

- Fixed non-masked voice playback delays (accidentally had them set to the same as masked delays).
- Fixed a null reference exception.

### 1.11.1

- Fixed a ``NullReferenceException`` issue with ``AudioReceiver``.

### 1.11.0

- Added two config options ``MinSilenceDurationMs`` and ``MinAudioDurationMs``, explained in their descriptions.
- Fixed an issue where recordings would end abruptely, even though the user didn't finish speaking their sentence.
- Fixed an issue related to ``Enable spawn control (masked enemies)`` being enabled.
- Thanks to ``nattaboy`` for all the feedback while testing the experimental build for the past week!

### 1.10.0

- Moved (and renamed) the following settings back to being a synced config option:
    - "Only hear a monster mimicking your own voice while spectating"
    - "Only record your voice while alive"
- Re-added LobbyCompatibility as a soft dependency.

### 1.9.2

- Updated MirageCore, which was missing dependencies causing players to crash.

### 1.9.1

**Note**: This will be the last update, unless any major gamebreaking bugs requires my attention. For anyone expecting the v2 (voice recognition + machine learning) update, please read the README on why this update has been dropped.

- Config has been reworked and requires you to **redo your config**. You will need to delete ``Mirage.cfg`` (backup the file in case you need it), and then use the newly generated ``Mirage.General.cfg`` and ``Mirage.Enemies.cfg`` configuration files.
- Enemy configs are now generated at runtime, no longer requiring a manual update for Mirage every time Zeekers adds new enemies.
- Optimized the codebase for better performance.
- Now uses [SileroVAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad) for better voice activity detection, resulting in better recordings when using voice activity.
- ``SpawnOnPlayerDeath`` as a feature has been removed. Use the [Zombies](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Synaxin/Zombies/) as a replacement.
- Added compatibility with [LethalIntelligence](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/LethalIntelligenceExperimental/).
- Thanks to [Lunxara](https://www.twitch.tv/lunxara), [JacuJ](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/JacuJ/), BBAPepsiMan, and JokerMan for extensively testing the update. I was only able to fix a lot of the subtle bugs they found because of their extensive testing.
- Updated icon, created by [IntegrityFate](https://integrityfate.com/).

### 1.9.0

- Made a mistake with the upload, this version is skipped.

### 1.8.1

- Fixed a compatibility issue for linux users. Thanks to [Coppertiel](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Coppertiel/) for reporting the bug!

### 1.8.0

- Added support for the following v56 enemies:
    - Clay Surgeon
    - Bush Wolf

### 1.7.2

- Added a config option to set the maximum number of naturally spawned masked enemies. By default, this is set to 2.
  Masked enemy spawns have already been capped at 2 since ``v1.7.1``, this update simply allows you to adjust that value.

### 1.7.1

- Fixed a bug that caused non-ascii file paths to fail to load. This means players with non-english usernames will finally be able to hear their own voices.

### 1.7.0

- Added a config entry ``RecordWhileDead``, that continues to record a player's voice while they're dead. Default value: ``false``.
- Fixed a bug that caused monsters to try to mimic disconnected players (resulting in no sound, since players must be connected in order to send their voices to others).

### 1.6.1

- Added a config entry ``UseCustomSpawnCurve``, that when enabled, changes masked enemies to spawn later in the day.
    - Requires ``EnableOverrideSpawnChance = true`` in order to work.
    - Credits: [TheDebbyCase](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/deB/) for explaining in-depth how spawn curves work.

### 1.6.0

- Fixed a bug that caused player dead bodies to disappaer.

### 1.5.4

- Temporarily reverted back to ``v1.5.2`` due to a new bug introduced in ``v1.5.3``.

### 1.5.3

- ~~Fixed a bug that caused player dead bodies to disappear.~~

### 1.5.2

- Voice clips are no longer created when [ToggleMute](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/quackandcheese/ToggleMute/) is toggled.

### 1.5.1

- Audio spatializer warning logs are now hidden.
    - This is a vanilla bug that occured more often with Mirage, due to cloning audio sources used by the vanilla game.
    - This log does not provide any value when debugging issues, so I opted to hide them instead.
    - Thanks to [IAmBatby](https://github.com/IAmBatby) and [mattymatty](https://github.com/mattymatty97) for their help/implementation.

### 1.5.0

- Fixed ``LocalPlayerVolume`` being accidentally synced. Each player can now control the volume of their mimicked voices, as originally intended.
- Fixed a bug that caused the ghost girl to mimic voices even with ``EnableGhostGirl`` set to ``false``.
- Fixed a bug that caused the ghost girl to mimic voices at the wrong timings.
- Recordings now also delete on game startup (previously only deleted when closing the game), while ``IgnoreRecordingsDeletion`` is set to ``false``.
- Changed the way masked enemies disable the arms-out animation to hopefully get rid of the rare issue of it having its arms-out when it's not supposed to.

### 1.4.0

- Added a config entry for the new enemies (butler, butler bees, flower snake, old bird).
- Removed debug logs that I previously left in by accident in ``v1.3.2``.
- Fixed a bug that caused modded enemies that extends from a vanilla enemy type to share its config entry.
- Fixed a bug that potentially caused an out-of-bounds error if a player dc'd when an enemy tries to mimic a player.

### 1.3.2

- Fixed a bug introduced in ``v1.3.0``, where some players didn't have their recordings folder deleted upon closing the game.
- Fixed a bug introduced in ``v1.3.1``, where voice clips sometimes get repeated multiple times in a row.

### 1.3.1

- Enemies mimicking a player now picks at a slightly less random way to avoid mimicking the same player multiple times in a row.
- ``MuteLocalPlayerVoice`` is now set to ``false`` by default, due to users who are new to the mod being confused why they can't hear their mimicked voice.

### 1.3.0

Note: This update removes a couple config entries in favour of new ones. You can safely ignore any orphaned config entries.

- Removed the config entry ``AlwaysMuteLocalPlayer`` in favour of ``LocalPlayerVolume``.
- Removed the config entry ``EnableNaturalSpawn`` as it only made sense to have in the past.
- Added the config entry ``LocalPlayerVolume``.
    - Allows you to adjust the playback volume for voice mimics of the local player.
    - Value must be between 0-1.
    - Default is set to 1.
    - This config entry is not synced to other players, as it's personal preference on what volume you want for your own "mimics".
- Added the config entry ``EnableOverrideSpawnChance``, which allows you to enable/disable the ``OverrideSpawnChance`` config.
    - Default is set to ``true``.
    - If you want to use a different spawn control mod (such as [LethalQuantities](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BananaPuncher714/LethalQuantities/)), simply set this to ``false``.
- Added the config entry ``OverrideSpawnChance``, allowing you to control how often masked enemies should spawn.
    - Value must be between 0-100 (as it's a percentage).
    - Default is set to 15.
    - Not to be confused with spawn weights. This will internally calculate the spawn weights for each moon to fit the desired percentage.
    - This will overwrite the spawn weights set by [LethalQuantities](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BananaPuncher714/LethalQuantities/) and [LethalLevelLoader](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/IAmBatby/LethalLevelLoader/). If you want to use those mods for spawn control, set ``EnableOverrideSpawnChance`` to ``false``.
    - Masked enemies spawn this way is capped at 2 (this counter is not shared with the ``SpawnOnPlayerDeath`` feature).
- Mimicking voices should *actually* sound like real player voices now.
    - This was previously attempted by imitating all the settings/filters that dissonance uses.
    - This is now replaced by using what dissonance uses internally.
- Enemies that mimic non-player voices now adjust playback volume, if the mimicking player's volume has been adjusted.
- Re-added support for [LobbyCompatibility](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BMX/LobbyCompatibility/).
- ``ImitationMode`` is now set to ``NoRepeat`` by default, to provide a better experience right out of the box.

### 1.2.1

- Temporarily removed support for [LobbyCompatibility](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BMX/LobbyCompatibility/). It currently has a bug that makes it a required dependency, causing Mirage to error when starting/joining a lobby, if you don't have it installed.

### 1.2.0

- Add support for [LobbyCompatibility](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BMX/LobbyCompatibility/)
    - Compatibility level is set to minor version. E.g. any ``1.2.X`` lobby is compatible with any other ``1.2.X`` version of Mirage.
    - This only applies to ``v1.2.X`` and forward, as I did not follow proper versioning in the ``1.0.X`` versions.
- Fixed issues of players not being able to hear voices mimicking them at times.

### 1.1.1

- Add configuration option ``ImitateMode`` to change how a recording is picked.
    - Set this to ``Random`` to keep the current behaviour (recordings are picked completely random).
    - Set this to ``NoRepeat`` to avoid repeating the same recording (this can still happen when not many recordings exist). Here is how it works:
        - A pool of recordings is filled.
        - A recording is randomly picked, and then removed from the pool.
        - When pool becomes empty, it becomes filled again.
- ``SpawnOnPlayerDeath`` no longer spawns an enemy if the player is not on a navmesh.
    - Previously, this was band-aid fixed by preventing a spawn if the player died by gravity.
    - ``CauseOfDeath: Gravity`` no longer prevents the masked enemy from spawning, meaning ladders can spawn them properly now.
    - Note: Many areas throughout the map such as standing on top of a railing is detected as a missing navmesh.
      Such areas will prevent ``SpawnOnPlayerDeath`` from spawning a masked enemy.

### 1.1.0

- Rewrote the config syncing logic. Thanks to Owen3H (author of CSync) for their config syncing [implementation](https://gist.github.com/Owen3H/c73e09314ed71b254256cbb15fd8c51e/5f314116ccd2ba3e5a2a38f01cf889dc674f2cfa).
- ``DeleteRecordingsPerRound`` has been slightly reworked.
    - Setting this to ``true`` is unchanged (recordings get deleted after the lever is pulled, per round).
    - Setting this to ``false`` now only deletes when closing the game.
    - Default value is now set to ``false``.
- ``MuteLocalPlayerVoice`` is now set to ``true`` as the default.
- ``EnablePenalty`` is now set to ``true`` as the default.
    - To clarify, setting this to ``true`` is the vanilla behaviour.
    - This will likely be removed in a future update, as it's a relic of the past back when Mirage had different goals.

### 1.0.16

- Fixed a bug that caused the ship teleporter to not work if ``SpawnOnPlayerDeath`` spawned a masked enemy
- [DissonanceLagFix](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/linkoid/DissonanceLagFix/) is no longer needed when using Mirage
- Modify configuration descriptions to hopefully be easier to understand
- Modify configuration default values

### 1.0.15

- Fixed a mod conflict issue that caused enemies to not despawn properly
- ``SpawnOnPlayerDeath`` no longer spawns an enemy when ``CauseOfDeath = Gravity`` (this means dying to fall damage, and I believe dying to the ladder as well)
    - This was originally done by **jarylc**, but I tried alternatives to avoid having the mechanic completely ignore dying to gravity
    - This is probably the best band-aid fix for now for avoiding log spam when a masked enemy spawns inside a pit

Huge thanks to **TheDebbyCase** for their immense effort on bug-testing and figuring out a way to reproduce errors that others have been experiencing.
Thanks to **dinogolfer** from TMLC for figuring out why non-masked enemies weren't despawning as well, which helped me understand why this mod conflict was even happening.

### 1.0.14

- Fixed a bug where some enemies types didn't mimic voices
- Add configuration option to always mute the mimicking voice of a local player
    - Set ``AlwaysMuteLocalPlayer`` to true to never hear your voice at all (even while dead)
    - This ignores the ``MuteLocalPlayerVoice`` value if enabled
    - This value is not synced to all clients, as it's an optional feature for those who don't want to hear their own voice

### 1.0.13

- AdvancedCompany cosmetics now properly apply on hosts (previously only applied on non-hosts)
- Fixed a bug that caused ``MuteLocalPlayerVoice`` to get ignored

### 1.0.12

- Mimicked voices should now sound a lot more like an actual player's voice (changed audio filters)
- ``SpawnOnPlayerDeath`` no longer spams an error if a player falls into the void
- Masked enemies no longer mimic voices if it was spawned after a player falls into the void

### 1.0.11

- Hotfix: Revert the crossed-out change from v1.0.10, which caused non-host players to not hear any voices

### 1.0.10

- Fixed dress girl issues
    - Mimicking voice is now muted while the dress girl is invisible
    - In singleplayer, dress girl will always mimic the local player's voice
    - In multiplayer, dress girl will always mimic the non-local player's voice
- Bees no longer mimic voices when ``EnableModdedEnemies`` is enabled.
- Add configuration option to mimic voices for locust swarms
- ~~Fixed navmesh error spam when an enemy tries to calculate its path~~
- Recordings deletion can now be ignored (not synced to all players)

### 1.0.9

- Ship camera now spectates the correct masked enemy
- Recording deletion can now be configured in two ways:
    - ``DeleteRecordingsPerRound = true`` to delete recordings per-round
    - ``DeleteRecordingsPerRound = false`` to delete recordings per-game
- Recordings now automatically delete upon closing the game

### 1.0.8

- Fixed a bug where voice filters weren't being applied, causing mimicked voices to behave unpredictably
- Fixed a bug where **SpawnOnPlayerDeath** could spawn two masked enemies in certain scenarios

### 1.0.7

- Hotfix: If the local player's mimicking voice is muted, it now becomes unmuted when the player is dead

### 1.0.6

Thanks to [jarylc](https://github.com/jarylc) for the initial [fixes](https://gist.github.com/jarylc/3f6fc305466d4970deae16629469b3c2) for masked enemy spawns.

- Rewrite masked enemy spawn and mimicking logic
    - This is less invasive now and should conflict with other mods less often
    - Fixed a bug where naturally spawned masked enemies weren't synced properly
- Fixed a bug where players not haunted by the ghost girl could hear the mimicking voice.
- Add configuration option to only spawn player on death, when the dying player is alone
- Add configuration option to mute the mimicking voice when mimicking the local player
- Add configuration option to adjust voice mimicking delay for non-masked enemies
- Add configuration option to mimic voices on modded enemies

### 1.0.5

- Use audio filters to sound more like vanilla voices
- Mimicked voices on the outside can no longer be heard from inside the facility (and vice-versa)
- Masked enemies no longer mimic voices while hiding on the ship

### 1.0.4

- Support voice mimicking on all vanilla enemies.
- Add configuration option for mask texture and arms-out animation (for masked enemies).
- Dead enemies no longer mimic voices.

### 1.0.3

- Support voice activity.

### 1.0.2

- Bundled all dependencies I control into a single core lib (users now pull less packages).

### 1.0.1

- Spawn on player death is now configurable.
- Naturally spawned masked enemies now mimic a player at random.
- Dependencies are now separated into its own packages.

### 1.0.0

- Initial release.
